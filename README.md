# App Chains (Real-Time Personalization)
=========================================
[App Chains](https://sequencing.com/developer-documentation/app-sequencing-and-app-chains) are the easy way to code [Real Time Personalization (RTP)](https://sequencing.com/developer-documentation/what-is-real-time-personalization-rtp) into your app. RTP allows your app to provide app users with a genetically tailored user experience.

App chain code is opensource and free to use, share, build upon and improve.

This repository contains code for App Chains in the following languages:

* Swift
* Objective-C
* Java-Android
* Java
* PHP
* Perl
* Python
* .NET/C#

Introduction
=========================================
An app chain is an integration of an API call and an analysis of an app user's genes. Each app chain provides information about a specific trait, condition, disease, supplement or medication. App chains are used to provide genetically tailored content to app users so that the user experience is instantly personalized at the genetic level. This is called [Real Time Personalization (RTP)](https://sequencing.com/developer-documentation/what-is-real-time-personalization-rtp). 

To code Real Time Personalization (RTP) technology into apps, developers may [register for a free account](https://sequencing.com/user/register/) at Sequencing.com. App development with RTP is always free.

Installation
======================================
The code for each App Chain is provided in various coding languages. App developers can cut and paste the code into their apps so that their apps can utilize RTP technology straight out-of-the-box.

Configuration
======================================
There are no strict configurations that have to be performed.

Troubleshooting
======================================
Each app chain code should work straight out-of-the-box without any configuration requirements or issues. 

Other tips

* To code Real-Time Personalization technology into your app, first [register for a free account](https://sequencing.com/user/register/) and use your account credentials when running the demo. You may then access all developer tools and information directly from the [Developer Center](https://sequencing.com/developer-center/).
* [Developer Documentation](https://sequencing.com/developer-documentation/) is also available.
* Review the [oAuth2](https://sequencing.com/developer-documentation/oauth2-guide) requirements.
* Review [Weather My Way +RTP app](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/Weather-My-Way-RTP-App), which is an weather app that uses Real-Time Personalization to provide genetically tailored content.
* Confirm you are connected to the internet since the API calls will be made to our server.
* Confirm you have the latest version of the code from this repository.
